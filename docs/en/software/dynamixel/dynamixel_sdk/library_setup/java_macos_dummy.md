To whom concern editing the dummy file...

This is the dummy file. You can delete it, but do not delete the original file named exactly same as the dummny without "_dummy" at the end of file name. 

Rule 1: Do not use dummy file. Use the original file.

Rule 2: The dummy file's permalink has the original's address. The original file's permalink is original link plus dummy_dummy_dummy. Do not forget you have to turn the address back by erasing dummy_dummy_dummy at the original file.
