## [C macOS](#c-macos)

### [Compiler and Builder](#compiler-and-builder)

#### [Compiler](#compiler)

The DYNAMIXEL SDK for Mac requires GNU gcc ver. 5.4.0 20160609 or higher
You'll need to install Homebrew in order to install the required gcc compiler
  ``` bash
  $ xcode-select --install
  $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  $ brew install gcc
  ```

You can verify your gcc installation with the following command:

  ``` bash 
  $ gcc --version
  ```

#### [Builder](#builder)

* Build-essential pkg â†’ make
* Download:  

  ``` bash 
  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
  ```

#### [Dependent Packages](#dependent-packages) 

* Packages needed for cross-compiling 
* Download:  

  ``` bash 
  $ sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib
  ```

#### [Build the Library](#build-the-library)

* PC which is being sold recently only comes as 64bit platform.  
  The Makefile is located in the following folder: `[DynamixelSDK folder]/c/build/mac` folder for 64-bit platforms.  
  Please note that if you will be building the 64-bit example source, you should build the 64-bit library.

-->
* Go to the Makefile's directory located in `[DynamixelSDK folder]/c/build/mac` using $ `cd`.

* To build the library file:  

  ``` bash
  $ make
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/c/mac/library_file/c1.png)
-->
* If there is an error:  

  ``` bash
  $ make clean && make
  ```

* To delete the library file and object files:  

  ``` bash
  $ make clean
  ```
<!--

-->

##### Copy (Install) the Library to the Root Directory

* To make library file and copy it to the root directory (to handle the serial port):  

  ``` bash
  $ sudo make install
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/c/mac/library_file/c3.png)
-->
* If there is an error:  

  ``` bash
  $ sudo make uninstall && sudo make install
  ```
 
  OR

  ``` bash
  $ sudo make reinstall
  ```

* To delete the library file from the root directory:  

  ``` bash
  $ sudo make uninstall
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/c/mac/library_file/c4.png)
-->
* To recopy the library file to the root directory:  

  ``` bash
  $ sudo make reinstall
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/c/mac/library_file/c5.png)
-->
* You will see the built library file in `[DynamixelSDK folder]/c/build/[linuxXX]/libdxl_mac_c.dylib`

### [Building and Running the Sample Code](#building-and-running-the-sample-code)

The DYNAMIXEL SDK example code for C uses a .dylib (Mac) library built in C.  
By doing above, each released DYNAMIXEL SDK have latest library files in `[DynamixelSDK folder]/c/build/mac/libdxl_mac_c.dylib` which were built by its own source code. 

* Go to the Makefile's directory using `cd`:  

  ``` bash
  $ cd [DynamixelSDK folder]/c/example/protocol1.0/read_write/mac
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/c/mac/sample_code/exc4.png)
-->
* Build the executable file: 

  ``` bash
  $ make
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/c/mac/sample_code/exc1.png)
-->
* If there is an error, `$ make clean` then `$ make` again.

* To delete the executable file, `$ make clean`.

-->
* Access the port you will be using to communicate with DYNAMIXEL: 

  ``` bash
  $ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/tty.usbserial-xxxx
  ```
<!--
  ![](/assets/images/sw/sdk/dynamixel_sdk/library_setup/c/mac/sample_code/exc3.png)
-->
* Run the executable file: 

  ``` bash
  $ ./read_write
  ```
