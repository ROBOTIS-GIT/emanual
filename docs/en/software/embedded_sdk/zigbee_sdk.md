# [Introduction](#introduction)

Zigbee SDK is a standard programming library to develop S/W communicates with RoboPlus Task with RoboPlus Task code. The characteristics of Zigbee SDK are as below.
- It has outstanding portability in each platform since written in C language.
- It is easy to perform platform porting since it is written in both platform independent and dependent sources.
- The interface is standardized; thus, the developed software can be used again even if the controller is different.

# [Platform Porting](#platform-porting)

Zigbee SDK provides sources so that the users can perform porting to various platforms.

- [Download ZIGBEE Porting SDK](https://robotis.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/support/en/baggage_files/zigbee_sdk/zigbee_sdk_porting_v1_00.zip)

## The Structure of Source

- Platform-independent Source  
  Platform-independent source is written in standard C language so as to be compiled in all C language compilers without H/W-dependent routine.   In this source, only the protocol-related contents are actualized to make instruction packet and analyze status packet.  The users, if there is no specific case, do not have to modify the contents of source.
  - Related Source File: zigbee.h, zigbee.c
  - Necessary File for Build: zgb_hal.h, zgb_hal.c

- Platform-dependent Source  
  Platform-dependent Source must include H/W-dependent routine in order to be actually operated in the controller.  If the users want to use Zigbee SDK in other unsupported platforms, the source must be modified.
  - Related Source File: zgb_hal.h, zgb_hal.c
 
If you want to do Porting, you must actualize the following functions depending on each platform.
- zgb_hal_open
- zgb_hal_close
- zgb_hal_tx
- zgb_hal_rx

## [zgb_hal_open](#zgb-hal-open)

It actualizes the available routine by initializing the communication devices.  
zgb_initialize activates the communication devices through  zgb_hal_open.
 
```c
int zgb_hal_open( 
  int devIndex, float baudrate 
)
```
 
#### Parameters

- devIndex : It is the number of currently connected communication devices. (It may vary pursuant to each platform.) For example, Windows distinguishes devices by COM Port.
- baudrate : It is the actual baudrate value.

#### Return Values

- The function returnes 1, if it is successful; otherwise , it returns 0.

## [zgb_hal_close](#zgb-hal-close)

It actualizes the routine that let other application programs use by terminating the communication devices.  
zgb_terminate terminates the communication devices through this function.

```c
void zgb_hal_close();
```
 
#### Parameters

- None

#### Return Values

- None

## [zgb_hal_tx](#zgb-hal-tx)

It actualizes the routine that transmits packet through the communication devices.
 
```c
int zgb_hal_tx( 
  unsigned char *pPacket, int numPacket 
);
```

#### Parameters

- pPacket : The pointer of the line includes the data to be trasmitted
- numPacket : The number of data to be transmitted

#### Return Values

- It returns the number of data actually transmitted.

## [zgb_hal_rx](#zgb-hal-rx)

It actualizes the routine that takes out packet from the received buffers of the communication devices.
 
```c
int zgb_hal_rx( 
  unsigned char *pPacket, int numPacket 
);
```
 
#### Parameters

- pPacket : The pointer of the line to save taken-out data
- numPacket : The number of data to be taken out

- [Download CM5_Echo.tsk](https://robotis.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/support/en/baggage_files/zigbee_sdk/cm5_echo.tsk)
- [Download CM510_Echo.tsk](https://robotis.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/support/en/baggage_files/zigbee_sdk/cm510_echo.tsk)
- [Download CM700_Echo.tsk](https://robotis.s3.ap-northeast-2.amazonaws.com/support/en/baggage_files/zigbee_sdk/cm700_echo.tsk)
 
#### Source

##### Initialization

```c
// Open device
if( zgb_initialize(DEFAULT_PORTNUM) == 0 )
{
  printf( "Failed to open Zig2Serial!\n" );
}
else
{
  printf( "Succeed to open Zig2Serial!\n" );
}
```

The source above checks whether the initialization is done properly or not.  
Since the initialization is succeeded, 1 is returned and if it is failed, 0 is returned, the failed source is included in "If" sentence, and the succeeded source goes to "Else" sentence.
zgb_initialize is called from Zigbee API.  
DEFAULT_PORTNUM means the number of a connected device.  
DEFAULT_PORTNUM must be set depending on the user's system status, and it is originally set to COM3.
 
##### Termination

```c
// Close device
zgb_terminate();
```

The source above terminates communication with the controller's communication device. zgb_terminate is called from Zigbee API.
 
##### Tramsmitting Pakcet

```c
if (zgb_tx_data(TxData) == 0)
{
  printf( "Failed to transmit\n" );
}
```

The source above makes Zigbee module to transmit the packet to the controller.  
Using zgb_tx_data function among Zigbee API, the users transmit packets and the results are returned.  
If the returned value is 1, the transmission is successful, and if it is 0, it means transmission failure.  
TxData means the value users transmit to the controller.
 
##### Receiving Packet

```c
for( i=0; i < TIMEOUT_TIME; i++)
{
  // Verify data recieved
  if(zgb_rx_check() == 1)
  {
    // Get data verified
    RxData = zgb_rx_data();
    printf( "Recieved: %d\n", RxData );
    break;
  }
  Sleep(1);
}
```

The source above makes Zigbee module to receive the packet from the controller.  
Using zgb_rx_check function, the users check whether the packet is received or not.  
If the returned value is 1, the reception is successful, and if it is 0, it means the reception failure.  
If the packet is received (if the returned value is 1), using zgb_rx_data function, the received data is saved in RxData variable.  
If the packet is not received, it spins the loop as much as the TIMEOUT_TIME using Sleep() function after providing the delay time of 1ms.  
TIMEOUT_TIME is initially set to 1000, and the packet is waited for 1 second in this example source.

DEFAULT_DEVICEINDEX must be set appropriately to the users' status.  
Baud Rate is fixed to 57600.
 
##### Termination

```c
// Close device
zgb_terminate();
```

The source is for termination. The connection is terminated by calling zgb_teminate function from zigbee API.
 
##### Transmitting Data

```c
// Wait user's input
printf( "Input number to transmit: " );
if(scanf("%d", &TxData));
  // Transmit data
if(zgb_tx_data(TxData) == 0)
  printf( "Failed to transmit\n" );
```
