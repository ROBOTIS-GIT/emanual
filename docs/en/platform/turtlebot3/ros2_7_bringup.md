## [Bringup TurtleBot3](#bringup-turtlebot3)

Launch a model of your TurtleBot3 including node of `robot_state_publisher` and `turtlebot3_node`.

**NOTE**: Before executing this command, you have to specify the model name of TurtleBot3. The `${TB3_MODEL}` is the name of the model you are using in `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi`. If you want to permanently set the export settings, please refer to [Export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL][export_turtlebot3_model]{: .popup} page.

```bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=${TB3_MODEL}
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py
```

If the node is successfully launched, the following instruction will appeared on the terminal window.
