**About OMY**

**The ROBOTIS OMY** is a 6-DOF robotic manipulator designed for **Physical AI research** and intelligent automation. Built with the high-performance **DYNAMIXEL-Y** series actuators, OMY enables skill acquisition through human demonstration, supporting imitation learning and reinforcement learning to perform increasingly complex manipulation tasks.

Optimized for pick-and-place, assembly, and inspection in academic, industrial, and development environments, OMY delivers high torque, smooth motion, and precise control. Its compact structure, modular design, and full **ROS 2 compatibility** make it a robust platform for AI-driven robotics development.

Discover the future of intelligent manipulation with **OMY** and the **DYNAMIXEL-Y** series.

## ðŸ§ Physical AI-based Skill Acquisition
The OMY manipulator leverages Physical AI to acquire new skills through human demonstrations. This enables intuitive teaching and adaptation to diverse tasks and environments without the need for extensive programming.

## âš¡Real-time Precision Manipulation
OMY perceives the workspace in real-time and responds immediately based on learned policies, making it well-suited for dynamic tasks that require responsiveness and reliability.

## ðŸ¦¾6-DOF Arm with DYNAMIXEL-Y Actuators
Built with the high-torque, high-resolution DYNAMIXEL-Y series, OMY delivers smooth, precise motion across 6 degrees of freedom, enabling accurate manipulation for industrial and research applications.

## ðŸ”„End-to-End Imitation Learning Pipeline
OMY supports the full imitation learning processâ€”from demonstration-based data collection to model inferenceâ€”providing a seamless interface for training and deploying intelligent motion policies.

## ðŸ“¦Modular & ROS 2 Native
OMYâ€™s modular design ensures flexibility in integration, while full ROS 2 compatibility supports real-time control, easy customization, and access to a robust open-source ecosystem.

## ðŸ¤–Compact, Deployable, and Developer-Friendly
With its lightweight structure and intuitive control interface, OMY is ideal for labs, classrooms, and automation setups, empowering developers and researchers to experiment and innovate efficiently.

## OMY Lineup Overview

The OMY series offers multiple configurations to suit various teleoperation and manipulation tasks. Below is a description of the available models:

- **OMY-L100:**
This is the leader unit designed for teleoperation. It provides an intuitive interface for controlling other OMY units remotely.

- **OMY-F3M:**
This model is equipped with a 2-finger gripper and an Intel RealSense D405 depth camera, making it ideal for object manipulation and perception tasks.

- **OMY-3M:**
The base configuration of OMY, without a gripper. It is suitable for general motion control or as a foundation for custom end-effector integration.
