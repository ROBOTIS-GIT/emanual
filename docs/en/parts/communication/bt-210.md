## Example
- Able to control the OLLO Bug using Bluetooth communication.
  - Connect BT-210 onto the OLLO Bug controller (CM-100A)
  - Able to wirelessly control the OLLO with the Android smart phone by connecting the BT-210 onto the OLLO.
- Using the PC to control the controller via Bluetooth communication.
  - Connect BT-210 onto the CM-900 and connect onto the Bluebooth port.
  - Able to mount the BT-201 onto the Bioloid Premium kit’s controller (CM-530)

`Caution` Please be sure to connect the device while the controller is turned off. Damage may occur if the device is connected while the power is turned on.

## [Available Baudrate](#available-baudrate)

{% include en/parts/communication/bt_baudrate.md %}

# [Communication Mode](#communication-mode)

Utilizes a pairing mechanism that allows reliable 1:1 communication.

## [1:1 Communication](#11-communication)

- When using two BT-210s, it is possible to set one as the “Master” and the other as the “Slave”  use the device to communicate with each other. Also, It is possible to use the BT-210 with a smart phone—with the Bluetooth capability—by setting BT-210 to “Slave mode” and pairing the two devices to each other.
- When the power is initially supplied to the BT-210, the blue LED blinks. Once the pairing is successful the blinking stops and the blue LED light is maintained.

# [BT-210 Setting](#bt-210-setting)

## [Setup](#setup)

1. Download sketch example for the OpenCM-9.04("f_SerialUSB_Serial2_Converter")

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_02.png)

2. Connect the BT-210 to the OpenCM9.04, then run Tera Term

    - `Download` [Tera Term](https://osdn.net/projects/ttssh2/releases/)

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_03.png)

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_04.png)

3. Once connection is complete baud rate can be any.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_05.png)

4. Go to Setup->Terminal and check local echo

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_06.png)

5. Enter `!` in terminal and if `OK` is returned, BT-210 is in `Command Mode`. Enter `AT` and if `OK` is returned, now BT-210 is ready for the setting.

6. Once setup is completed, reconnect the BT-210 with the controller. The picture shows BT-210 is set as a Master.

# [AT Commands](#at-commands)

The following are AT terminal commands for the BT-210

1. System reset  
  Enter ATZ press the Enter key and the BT-210 resets.if settings have changed the mode will change upon reset.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_09.png)

2. Mode change  
    - Use this command to switch between master and slave modes for the BT-210.
      - AT+BTROLE=M -> Master mode
      - AT+BTROLE=S -> Slave mode
    - Afterwards enter ATZ to reset.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_10.png)

    > MASTER Mode

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_11.png)

    > SLAVE Mode

3. Peripheral device search  
  This is possible only in master mode. Enter AT+BTINQ followed by the Enter key the device class comes as 0x1F00(SPP).

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_12.png)

4. Connecting devices (pairing)  
  Once devices have been found they can be connected via its 12-digit hex MAC address.
  for example a device with MAC address of abc2-ff-123458 enter ATDabc2ff123458 (ignore the – sign). When asked for pin code enter 0000.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_13.png)

5. Change pin code
  - AT+BTKEY=digit Pin Code
  - To change pin code follow the procedure below.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_14.png)

    - then enter AT+BTKEY (ignore the = sign)

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_15.png)

6. Output current device class  
  Output of SPP (serial port profile) 0x1f00

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_16.png)

7. Change Bluetooth device name  
  AT+BTNAME = for name change

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_17.png)

8. Device Under Test (DUT) mode  
  Under this mode the device is a “test” device and not suited for applications.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/bt-210_18.png)

    Enter AT+BTDUT then ATZ  (make sure is in slave mode)  
    To get out of DUT mode enter AT+BTDUT one more time then ATZ

9. Change Baudrate  
  AT+BTUART,baudrate,parity_bit,stop_bit  
  `Example` AT+BTUART,57600,n,1
