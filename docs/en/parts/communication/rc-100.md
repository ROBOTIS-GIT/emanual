`Caution` RC-100A is **DISCONTINUED**.
{: .notice--warning}

This is a devices to communicate with the robot via IR, ZIGbee, or Bluetooth.  
If nothing is mounted the default communications is via IR.  
Mount the ZIG-100 to communicate via ZIGbee.  
Mount the BT-100 to communicate via Bluetooth.  

{% capture rc-100_01 %}
`Caution`
- `RC-100` does NOT support Bluetooth(Only IR).
- `RC-100A` supports BT-100/ZIG-100 modules and IR.
- `RC-100B` supports BT-100/BT-210/BT-410/ZIG-100 modules and IR.

3. Automatic Powersave Mode
  - If RC-100 is not used for more than 2 minutes, (if no buttons are pressed) the power is automatically turned off.
4. Transmitting button-pressed status
  - If the button of RC-100B is pressed, the packet related to the pressed button is transmitted to the receiving module which is synchronized by the connected transmitting module.
  - Even at the moment of releasing all buttons, the packet which shows the buttons are not pressed is transmitted.
  - Please refer to Remote Control [Code Map](#code-map) on the packet.
5. Check firmware version
  - Firmware version 1.4 will blink blue LED 4 times when holding 5, 6 buttons while turning on the controller.
  - Firmware version 1.4 will save the channel setting when power is off.

# [How to Set IR Channel](#how-to-set-ir-channel)

Can set communication channel in between 1 ~ 8 for controlling by IR wireless communication. To connect the wireless communication, the channel setting of receiver should be the same with that of sender. Following is the method for IR wireless communication channel setting. (Please refer to [RC-100 Channel Programming] for setting controller channel)

> The controller with Firmware Version 1.4 saves channel setting when power is off.

# [Install ZIG-100/BT-100](#install-zig-100bt-100)

1. Open the cover of the rc-100 and insert the zig-100 module properly. (You can insert both zig-100 and bt-100 into the RC-100A.)

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/rc-100_06.jpg)

2. Insert the module as below so that  the red-circled parts can contact each other.

    ![](/assets/images/parts/communication/rc-100_07.jpg)

3. Press firmly to insert ZIG-100/BT-100 module using fingers or long stick etc.

# [How to Set Broadcasting Channel](#how-to-set-broadcasting-channel)

It is possible to set  4 channels with buttons, if the ZIG-100 on RC-100Z was set at Broadcasting Mode (Multi: Multi communication mode).  
Channels can be changed if you press the number buttons (1~4) together while MODE buttons are being pressed.  
The red LED will blink as many as the channel no. , when the channel is changed.  

{% capture rc_100_caution_01 %}
`Caution`  
1. At initial status, it is of no use to change the channel because  it is automatically set at One: One communication mode, instead of  Multi : Multi communication mode.  
2. The ZIG-100 communication can be discontinued for seconds when changing the channels.  
3. When you take away batteries, the channel will be reset at initial status automatically and you need to reset it.

# <a name="code-map"></a>[Code Map](#code-map)

**NOTE** : Button 5 and 6 are not available under IR control mode.
{: .notice}

When you press the buttons on RC-100, corresponding code value of each button will be sent out.

![](/assets/images/parts/communication/rc-100_12.png)

When more than 2 buttons are pressed, the sum of pressed code values will be sent.  
- `Example` Button U + Button 3 => Code value of Button U (1) + Code value of Button 3 (64) = Sending Value (65)
- `Example` Button 1 + Button 5 => Code value of Button 1 (16) + Code value of Button 5 (256) = Sending Value (272)

**NOTE** : There are 128 combination keys usable in IR Mode.There are 512 combinations keys usable in Zigbee Mode.

# [Communication Packet](#communication-packet)

The RC-100 uses the communication packet in the form below

![](/assets/images/parts/communication/rc-100_13.gif)

- `~` represents Inverse (1’s Complement)  
  - `Example` ~0xAA -> 0x55, ~0xF0 -> 0x0F
  - `Example` `DATA` : 0x1234 -> `Packet` : 0xFF 0x55 0x34 0xCB 0x12 0xED

# [How to Insert Batteries](#how-to-insert-batteries)
