> CM-151

- Used with DREAM robots and supports various components used (reduction motors, servo motors, LED modules, IR sensor, etc).
- BLE (Bluethooth Low Entry) function is included.
- Firmware Recovery to CM-151 can be performed using [R+ Manager 2.0].
- Control connected components using Task programming such as [R+ Task 3.0].

**NOTE**: R+ Motion does NOT support the CM-151. See [Controller Compatibility](/docs/en/parts/controller/controller_compatibility/) for more details.

# [Control Table](#control-table)
Control Table consists of data regarding the current status and operation of controller. The user can control controller by changing data of Control Table via Instruction packet.

- EEPROM and RAM  
  Data in RAM area is reset to initial values whenever the power is turned on while data in EEPROM area is kept once values are set even if the power is turned off.

- Address  
  Represents the location of data. To read from or write data to the control table the user should assign the correct address in the Instruction packet.

- Access  
  Controller has two kinds of data: Read-only data, used mainly for sensing, and read-and-write data used for driving.

- Initial Value  
  In case of data in the EEPROM Area, the initial values on the right side of the below Control Table are the factory default settings.  
  In case of data in the RAM Area, the initial values on the right side of the following control table are the ones when the power is turned on.

- Size  
  The Size of data varies from 1 ~ 4 bytes depend on their usage. Please check the size of data when updating the data with an Instruction Packet.

- BLE MAC Address: Unique BLE MAC address of CM-151.

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/cm-151/cm_151_aux_led.png)

- POWER LED: RED LED indicates if powered on.
- BLE STATUS LED: BLUE LED indicates if paired with BLE Central Device.
- USER LED: GREEN LED can be controlled by user’s program.

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/cm-150/cm-150_001.jpg)

- Start button: After a short press the POWER LED(RED) will turn on and the loaded program runs
- IR sensors : measure each of the integrated 3 IR sensors

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/cm-151/cm_151_layout.png)

- Bluetooth LE : built-in BLE, possible to connect to BT-410 dongle or Smart Devices.
- Top 4-pin port : located next to the "Start button" connect an IR receiver or [BT-210] / [BT-110] / [ZIG-110] / [BT-410] wireless communication modules.
- Micro USB port: located next to the 4-pin port connect a micro USB cable to the PC.
- Port 1 ~ 2 : shown as “I” and “II” connect reduction motors
- Port 3 ~ 4 : shown as “III” and “IIII” connect IR sensors, touch sensors, servo motors and LED modules.

# [Connecting Power](#connecting-power)

- Power for the CM-151 is supplied by a single LBS-041 (040) Li-ion battery
- Operating voltage range: 3.0-4.7V (3.7V recommended)
- Power polarity pins are shown in the diagram below

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/cm-150/cm-150_003.jpg)

# [How to Operate](#how-to-operate)

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/cm-100/cm-100_004.jpg)

- Press the "Start button" once shortly. The POWER LED turns on, and the controller runs one downloaded program
- Press the "Start button" to turn on then press the Start N times. The controller is can run a specific part of a program given said N number of presses.
- Hold the "Start button" for more than 1 second and it will emit 2 beep sounds, LED turns on, and the controller is under management mode (Downloaded task will not run under this mode).
- To turn off the controller press the "Start button"
- The controller automatic turn-off time is 5 seconds by default. See [Automatic Turn-off] for more details.
- Hold the "Start button" for more than 5 seconds and it will emit 3 beep sounds. The controller is in USB firmware update mode. User can update firmware with [R+ Manager 2.0].
- In USB firmware update mode, press "Start button" for 3 times, then the controller will be recovered to last updated firmware after a short “bi-li-li-li-li” melody. The controller will be turned off after firmware recovery.
- In USB firmware update mode, press "Start button" for 1 time, then the controller will be turned off.

# [Connect to PC (Micro USB)](#connect-to-pc-micro-usb)

- To connect the CM-151 to the PC a micro USB cable is required.
- For more information for PC connection check [USB driver installation] page.

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/cm-150/cm-150_004.jpg)

# [Wireless Communication](#wireless-communication)

- CM-151 is capable of BLE communication, therefore is compatible with BT-410 Dongle or smart device.
- Connect CM-151 to BT-410 Dongle by placing them within 5cm.
- Connect Smart Devices to specific CM-151 with unique MAC address of each CM-151.  

  ![](/assets/images/parts/controller/cm-151/cm_151_ble_address.png)
  > Mac address of CM-151

- When CM-151 is NOT paired with a BLE Central Device (Smart Phone or BT-410 Dongle, etc.), the BLUE LED of CM-151 will blink.
- Once CM-151 is paired with a BLE Central Device, the BLUE LED of CM-151 will be turned on without blinking.
