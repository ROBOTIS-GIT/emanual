# [Connecting Power](#connecting-power)

The power is applied  if the battery is connected to battery socket of CM-530 or if the power switch is set to ON after connecting SMPS to power jack socket. If the power is impressed, Power LED is turned on and one of the Mode Display LEDs flickers.

# [How to Operate](#how-to-operate)

- **Turning the power on** : The power is turned on by moving the switch from OFF to ON.
  ※ If the power is not turned on in spite of moving the switch to ON, the batteries may have been discharged.
  Pleaser refer to Charging to recharge, or connect the power using SMPS.
- **Start** : Move to PLAY using Mode Button to operate robots.  Press START Button to execute when the LED on PLAY flickers.
  ※ If START button is pressed, the LED on PLAY is not supposed to be flickering any more; that is the normal status of the execution.
- **End** :  If you want to stop the executed operations, press MODE Button to get back to waiting mode stauts, or turn OFF the power using Power Switch.
- It is used to control DYNAMIXEL and the peripherals, and it can connect DYNAMIXEL(AX/MX DYNAMIXEL... etc.) and various parts of OLLO(Touch Sensor, LED Module, IR Sensor etc.).
- Specific motions can be edited and saved through RoboPlus Motion.  The saved motion (mtn file) can be always executed by RoboPlus Task, and also the motions of each part can be controlled by writing the task codes for control.

- RoboPlus Motion

# [Charging](#charging)

You may obtain Lithium polymer batteries from [www.robotis-shop-en.com](www.robotis-shop-en.com).

If the robot alarm sounds off during operations then recharge the battery.

During charging the charger’s red LED turns on. When complete the green LED turns on.

1. Take the battery out

## Charging Time and Battery Life/Operating

### Charging Time

- When fully discharged : 1~1.5 hour
- Leaving the battery fully discharged for too long may reduce its lifespan drastically.
- Time to charge the battery depends on the status of the battery(If the charging time or battery life becomes too short, you may need to replace your battery).

{% capture stem_charge_caution_01 %}
`Caution`
1. Do NOT  keep the battery connected with a robot or a charger.
2. If you will not use the battery for a long time from now on, please keep it HALF-CHARGED.
3. Do NOT  put the battery with an environment with high temperature or humidity.
