> RB-88 Controller

# [Introduction](#introduction)

- The RB-88 is a controller used in the OLLO Spark and OLLO Excel Kit, featuring Bluetooth functionality and built-in devices such as motor output shafts and various input/output devices (infrared sensor, microphone, LED, buzzer).
- The RB-88 controller is compatible with ROBOTIS' 12mm standard products.
- Firmware updates and recovery can be done via the STEAMCUP app.
- You can program the RB-88 with [R-Block] and download the program to make the controller operate.

# [Control Table](#control-table)

Control Table consists of data regarding the current status and operation of controller. The user can control controller by changing data of Control Table via Instruction packet.

- **EEPROM and RAM**  
  Data in RAM area is reset to initial values whenever the power is turned on while data in EEPROM area is kept once values are set even if the power is turned off.

- **Address**  
  Represents the location of data. To read from or write data to the control table the user should assign the correct address in the Instruction packet.

- **Access**  
  Controller has two kinds of data: Read-only data, used mainly for sensing, and read-and-write data used for driving.

- **Initial Value**  
  In case of data in the EEPROM Area, the initial values on the right side of the below Control Table are the factory default settings.  
  In case of data in the RAM Area, the initial values on the right side of the following control table are the ones when the power is turned on.

- **Size**  
  The Size of data varies from 1 ~ 4 bytes depend on their usage. Please check the size of data when updating the data with an Instruction Packet.

- **Power Button**: Short press to turn on. The power LED lights up, and the controller enters Play Mode and downloaded program on the controller starts running. If held for more than 3 seconds, the buzzer beeps twice, indicating Manage Mode. Holding for about 9 seconds results in three beeps, indicating Firmware Recovery Mode.
- **Power LED**: Pressing the power button causes the blue LED to flash. When connected to the BT-430 dongle, the blue LED remains on without flashing.
- **LED 1,2 (LED)**: Indicator LEDs that can be turned on or off through programming.
- **IR Sensor (1~6)** (Infrared Sensor): Six infrared sensors, allowing programming using sensor values from different directions.
- **3Pin DXL Port (1,2) (3-pin port)**: Located below the power button, can be used to connect [XL330-M077-T](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xl330-m077/) and [XL330-M288-T](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/x/xl330-m288/), and more.
- **Center Motor Shaft**: For attaching a cross axle. The gear ratio is 30:1.
- **Rear Motor Shaft**: For attaching a cross axle. The gear ratio is 60:1.

# [Power Supply](#power-supply)

The RB-88 is powered by three AA batteries.

# [Controller Modes](#controller-modes)

## [Play Mode](#play-mode)

- With the controller off, briefly press the power button to start, and the blue LED lights up, indicating the controller is in Play mode.
- Play mode executes R-Block programs downloaded to the controller.
- The number of times you press the start button in succession at the initial start increases the button press count. You can use this parameter for programming to make RB-88 perform different actions depending on the number of times you press the start button.
- In Play mode, if Bluetooth is not paired with a leader device, the blue LED will flash. When paired, the blue LED remains on without flashing.

## [Manage Mode](#manage-mode)

- With the controller off, press and hold the power button for about 1 second until you hear two short beeps, and the blue LED lights up, indicating the controller is in Manage mode.
- In Manage mode, you can download R-Block programs.
- In Manage mode, if Bluetooth is not paired with a leader device, the blue LED will flash. When paired, the blue LED remains on without flashing.

## [Recovery Mode](#recovery-mode)

- With the controller off, press and hold the power button for about 9 seconds until there is no more sound. This indicates entry into Recovery mode.
- In Recovery mode, both the orange and blue LEDs will flash.
- Connect the RB-88 controller in Recovery mode by clicking "Add Robot" in the STEAMCUP app. ([Connect from Mobile](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/controller/rb-88/#connect-from-mobile))
- Do not close the app during the update.
- Place your smartphone as close as possible to the controller during the update.

## [Controller Shutdown](#controller-shutdown)

To turn off the controller when it's on, press the start button again.

# [Control Dynamixels via Bluetooth](#control-dynamixels-via-bluetooth)
- When the controller is in Manage mode, you can control Dynamixels using their IDs connected to the controller.
- After confirming the model name of the Dynamixels connected to the controller, please refer to the Dynamixel control table in the [e-Manual](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/dxl/).


# [Cross Hub Assembly](#cross-hub-assembly)

Insert the end of the cross shaft into the cross hub on the RB-86, making sure their directions match.

# [Straightness Calibration](#straightness-calibration)

- When running either of the following R-Block blocks, the RB-86 will automatically attempt to correct straightness during motion.

    ![rb_88_foward](/assets/images/parts/controller/rb-88/rb_88_foward_en.jpg){: width='400px'}
    ![rb_88_backward](/assets/images/parts/controller/rb-88/rb_88_backward_en.jpg){: width='400px'}

- Long-distance travel is required for straightness calibration to be completed.
- The straightness calibration value is retained even when the power is turned off.
