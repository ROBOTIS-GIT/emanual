# CM-700

# [Introduction](#introduction)

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/cm-700/cm-700_product.jpg)

- **CM-700** is a control module type controller with a CPU, TTL / RS485 communication circuit and ZIG-110 connector. You cannot control dynamixels or other peripheral devices alone with the CM-700. You will need a SUB board.  
- **CM-700 SUB Board** is composed of a power department, connector department, switch, and an additional circuit for 5 pin peripheral devices.
- You may refer to the connector pin layout to make your own SUB board.

# [Connecting Power](#connecting-power)

The CM-700 which consists of a micro-controller, is divided into a power department, various connectors, and SUB board. Depending on the connection of each board, the working voltage range may change so please refer to the below information to make your own battery.

- CM-700 + User's Custom SUB Board  
  Because the CM-700 does not have a regulator, the power supply from the user’s custom SUB board to the CM-700 must be 5V.
  - CM-700 Working Voltage : 4.5 ~ 5.5 V
 
- CM-700 + CM-700 SUB Board  
  When connecting and using the CM-700 and ROBOTIS’s SUB board only, below is the allowed power range for the SUB board.
  - CM-700 + SUB Working Voltage : 7 ~ 35 V
 
- CM-700 + CM-700 SUB Board + Dynamixels  
  Our SUB board has a comprehensive working voltage range to use all released dynamixel line-ups. Thus, the working voltage for the SUB board is restricted depending on the dynamixel you are using.
  - When using 2 or more different types of dynamixels together, the voltage range must be where all of the dynamixels can work. Thus, the minimum voltage should be the dynamixel’s highest voltage spec and the maximum voltage should be the lowest voltage to suit the working range.
  - For example, when using the AX-12+ and RX-64 together, AX-12+ is 7 ~ 12 V, and RX-64 is ~ 18 V. Thus the working voltage would be 12V, meaning Li-Po conversion would be 3 cells and Ni-MH would be converted in 10 cells.

|Dynamixel In Use|Min. Voltage|Max. Voltage|Li-Po Conversion|Ni-MH Conversion|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|AX-12A|9|12|3 cells|8 ~ 10 cells|
|DX-117|12|18.5|3 ~ 5 cells|10 ~ 15 cells|
|RX-10|9|12|3 cells|8 ~ 10 cells|
|RX-28|12|18.5|3 ~ 5 cells|10 ~ 15 cells|
|RX-64|12|18.5|3 ~ 5 cells|10 ~ 15 cells|
|EX-106+|12|18.5|3 ~ 5 cells|10 ~ 15 cells|
|MX Series|10|14.8|3 ~ 4 cells|9 ~ 12 cells|

Connect the battery into the CM-700’s battery socket, and then set the power switch to supply power. Once the power is supplied, the POWER LED will turn on, and one of the MODE LED will start blinking.

# [How to Operate](#how-to-operate)

- **Turning the power on** : The power is turned on by moving the switch from OFF to ON.  
- **Start** : Move to PLAY using Mode Button to operate robots. Press START Button to execute when the LED on PLAY flickers.  
  ※ If START button is pressed, the LED on PLAY is not supposed to be flickering any more; that is the normal status of the execution.  
- **End** : If you want to stop the executed operations, press MODE Button to get back to waiting mode stauts, or turn OFF the power using Power Switch.

- It is used to control Dynamixel and the peripherals, and it can connect Dynamixel(AX-12A, AX-18A, AX-S1, DX-Series, RX-Series, EX-Series) and various parts of OLLO(Touch Sensor, LED Module, IR Sensor etc.).
- Specific motions can be edited and saved through RoboPlus Motion.  The saved motion (mtn file) can be always executed by RoboPlus Task, and also the motions of each part can be controlled by writing the task codes for control.

- RoboPlus Motion

- Embedded C  
  The controller of CM-700 can be controlled in C language.  Please refer to [Embedded C] for more information.

# [Connect to PC](#connect-to-pc)

For the PC and CM-700 to communicate, [LN-101] must be connected to CM-700 Port.

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/cm-700/cm-700_04.png)

# [Wireless Communication](#wireless-communication)

[ZIG-110] wireless communication module can be connected to CM-700.

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/cm-700/cm-700_05.jpg)

# [Fuse Replacement](#fuse-replacement)

There is a fuse to prevent from damaging the circuit due to over current.  
If the CM-700 does not turn on, there is a high chance your fuse is blown. Replace the fuse right away.
 
※ The fuse size of CM-700 is as below, and you may use a product with a capacity between 125V / 5A ~ 10A. (It is the same as [CM-510])
