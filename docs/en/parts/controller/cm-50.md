# [Control Table](#control-table)
Control Table consists of data regarding the current status and operation of controller. The user can control controller by changing data of Control Table via Instruction packet.

## EEPROM and RAM
Data in RAM area is reset to initial values whenever the power is turned on while data in EEPROM area is kept once values are set even if the power is turned off.

## Address  
Represents the location of data. To read from or write data to the control table the user should assign the correct address in the Instruction packet.

## Access  
Controller has two kinds of data: Read-only data, used mainly for sensing, and read-and-write data used for driving.

## Initial Value  
In case of data in the EEPROM Area, the initial values on the right side of the below Control Table are the factory default settings.  
In case of data in the RAM Area, the initial values on the right side of the following control table are the ones when the power is turned on.

## Size  
The Size of data varies from 1 ~ 4 bytes depend on their usage. Please check the size of data when updating the data with an Instruction Packet.

## [Tuning Mode](#tuning-mode)

- Each motor can be tuned for the straight forware / backward movements.
- Two methods are available to start the Tuning mode.

### [First Method](#first-method)

1. Place a white paper in front of the left and right IR sensor of CM-50.
2. Press and hold the `Start Button` until two(2) beeps, then release the button.
3. A melody will be played if the controller is entered to the Tuning Mode.

**NOTE** : If a melody is not played after the two beeps, the CM-50 controller is started with Manage Mode.  
Please turn off the controller and try again.
{: .notice}

**WARNING** : Please disconnect [BT-210] or [BT-410] modules from CM-50. Tuning Mode cannot be started when bluetooth modules are connected.
{: .notice--warning}

### [Second Method](#second-method)

1. Turn on the CM-50 controller.
2. Press and hold the `Start Button` until three(3) beeps, then release the button.
3. A melody will be played if the controller is entered to the Tuning Mode.

**WARNING** : Please hold down the `Start Button` firmly until to hear three beeps or else the controller could be turned off.
{: .notice--warning}

# [Straightness Tuning](#straightness-tuning)

If the robot dosen’t move straight and keep steering to the right or left, the straightness can be tuned under Tuning Mode.  
In order to synchronize right and left wheel speed, you need to tune the motor with a remote controller([RC-100B](#rc-100b), [RC-200](#rc-200), [Smart Device](#smart-device)).

{% capture notice01 %}  
**NOTE** : Tuning Mode for CM-50 is supported from the Firmware version 77 or above.

<div class="notice">{{ notice01 | markdownify }}</div>

## [RC-100B](#rc-100b)
1. Prepare a pair of [BT-210] or [BT-410] (Master/Slave module).
2. Start the CM-50 controller with [Tuning Mode](#tuning-mode).
3. Connect the BT-210 or BT-410 Slave module to CM-50 controller.
4. Connect the BT-210 or BT-410 Master module to RC-100B remote controller.
5. Follow the [Tuning Guide](#tuning-guide) to tune the motor speed, then save the configuration.

## [RC-200](#rc-200)
[RC-200](/docs/en/parts/communication/rc-200/) supports IR communication with controller.
In order to use RC-200 for the tuning, IR communication channel has to be configured before tuning the motor.

1. Start the CM-50 controller with [Manage Mode](#manage-mode).
2. Press and hold down `V` and `↲` button for 5 seconds until `2`, `4`, `7`, `8`, `9` buttons on RC-200 light up.
3. Select the channel to use(1 ~ 25), then enter the channel number from RC-200.
4. Press the `↲` button to save the channel setting.
5. Three beeps will sound consecutively if RC-200 is succesfully connected to the controller.
6. Start the CM-50 controller with [Tuning Mode](#tuning-mode).
7. Follow the [Tuning Guide](#tuning-guide) to tune the motor speed, then save the configuration.

**NOTE** : Please point the RC-200 to IR receiver of the controller for the best signal reception.
{: .notice}

## [Smart Device](#smart-device)
Smart devices with [R+ m.Task 2.0] app can be used as a remote controller instead of RC-100B or RC-200.

1. Install [R+ m.Task 2.0](/docs/en/software/rplus_mobile/mtask20/#app-installation) on the smart device.
2. Start the CM-50 controller with [Tuning Mode](#tuning-mode).
3. Connect the BT-210 or BT-410 Slave module to CM-50 controller.
4. Run R+ m.Task 2.0 then use [Remote Controller Program]{: .blank} to connect the CM-50 controller.
5. Follow the [Tuning Guide](#tuning-guide) to tune the motor speed, then save the configuration.

**CAUTION** : [BT-210] and [BT-110] do not support iOS smart devices.
