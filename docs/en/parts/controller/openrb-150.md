# [Overview](#overview)

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/openrb-150/OpenRB-150_modeling_quarterview.png)

> OpenRB-150

The OpenRB-150 is a new open source Arduino compatible Microcontroller.

The controller features the same pinout and the form factor as the Arduino MKR to ensure compatibility with phyisical accessories, and has support for programming using the Arduino IDE.

The OpenRB-150 also features 4 dedicated DYNAMIXEL ports, and supports the DYNAMIXEL Wizard 2.0 testing and calibration softwere.

**NOTE** : Specialty firmware is required to utilize the OpenRB-150 with DYNAMIXEL Wizard. This firmware is included in the OpenRB board manager package.

{% capture openrb-150_caution_01 %}
**WARNING**
- The current from the USB port is limited to 500mA with the built-in fuse, but a high current draw may cause damage to USB ports used to power the OpenRB-150.
- For applications requiring rapid movement or high torque, use of the terminal block to supply power is recommended.
- Always confirm the operating voltage of your DYNAMIXEL modules before connecting them to the OpenRB-150.

# [Hardware Layout](#hardware-layout)

## [Pinout](#pinout)

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/openrb-150/openrb-150_pinout.png)

## [Reset Button](#reset-button)
Pressing the `Reset Button` hard reboots the microcontroller, double pressing the `Reset Button` reboots the microcontroller into bootloader mode. 

The OpenRB-150 will not load it's Arduino sketch(or firmware) when in bootloader mode.

{% capture openrb-150_warning_01 %}
**WARNING**  
Resetting the microcontroller will also reset the power of any connected DYNAMIXELs ([Power Switch](#dynamixel-power-switch)).

It is important to only reset the microcontroller when the acutators are in a safe postion, to avoid possible damage or injury when the acuators are reset.
{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice--danger">{{ openrb-150_warning_01 | markdownify }}</div>

## [DYNAMIXEL Power Switch](#dynamixel-power-switch)
Power to the DYNAMIXEL ports is controlled by the FET on the bottom of the microcontroller.

The FET can enable and disable the power to the connected ports, by default the FET is turned off whenever the OpenRB-150 is powered on.

When the FET is turned on, the `DXL` RED LED will also be turned on to confirm the power supply status.

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/openrb-150/openrb-150_switch.png)

## [Terminal VIN](#terminal-vin)
The included terminal block provides compatiblity with a wide range of input power sources.  
ROBOTIS recommends using the terminal block to supply power when possible.

To supply power to the OpenRB-150 controller via the Terminal VIN, set the jumper to `VIN(DXL)` side as shown below.

### XT60 Connector

The XT60 connector is widely used in the RC products and it can be assembled on the back of the OpenRB-150 controller.  
Please remove the Terminal Block before soldering the XT60 right angle connector.

> XT60 Connector Ready


## [Power Source Jumper](#power-source-jumper)
OpenRB-150 can be powered with three sources.  
In order to properly supply power to the controller and DYNAMIXEL, the power source jumper needs to be set properly.

## [Serial Port](#serial-port)
The Serial Port assigned to `Serial2` can be used to connect various devices for debugging the code or controlling the controller.

![](/assets/images/parts/controller/openrb-150/openrb-150_serial_port.png)

## [LEDs](#leds)
Three LED indicates the status of the OpenRB-150 controller.

- `PWR` (Green) : This LED is turned on whenever the OpenRB-150 is powered.
- `USER` (Orange) : This LED can be controlled by user via Pin `32` or `LED_BUILTIN` in the Arduino sketch code.
- `DXL` (Red) : This LED will be turned on when the DYNAMIXEL port is powered on.
