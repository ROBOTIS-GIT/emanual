# [Control Table](#control-table)

Control Table consists of data regarding the current status and operation of controller. The user can control controller by changing data of Control Table via Instruction packet.

- **EEPROM and RAM**  
  Data in RAM area is reset to initial values whenever the power is turned on while data in EEPROM area is kept once values are set even if the power is turned off.

- **Address**  
  Represents the location of data. To read from or write data to the control table the user should assign the correct address in the Instruction packet.

- **Access**  
  Controller has two kinds of data: Read-only data, used mainly for sensing, and read-and-write data used for driving.

- **Initial Value**  
  In case of data in the EEPROM Area, the initial values on the right side of the below Control Table are the factory default settings.  
  In case of data in the RAM Area, the initial values on the right side of the following control table are the ones when the power is turned on.

- **Size**  
  The Size of data varies from 1 ~ 4 bytes depend on their usage. Please check the size of data when updating the data with an Instruction Packet.

# [Connecting Power](#connecting-power)
In order to supply power to CM-550, either connect the battery to `BAT` battery socket or plug the 12V SMPS DC barrel (2.5mm ID / 5.5mm OD, Center Positive) into `12VDC` jack.  
Set the `POWER` switch to **ON** and the Status LED will be turned on.  

**NOTE** : If `12VDC` is connected to the power source, the CM-550 controller will cut the `BAT` input.

# [How to Operate](#how-to-operate)

## [Power Up](#Power Up)
Setting the `POWER` switch to **ON** will turn on the CM-550 controller.  

If the controller does not turn on, the battery might have been depleted. Please refer to [Charging Battery] section to charge the battery, or use 12V SMPS power supply to operate the robot.  
{: .notice}

## [Start](#start)
In order to operate the robot, press the `MODE` button until the button flashes green. While the `MODE` LED is flickering in green, press the `START` button to run the downloaded task code.  

If the `MODE` LED stops flickering after pressing the `START` button, task is running normally.
