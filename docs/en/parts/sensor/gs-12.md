# Gyro Sensor(GS-12)

![](/assets/images/parts/sensors/gs-12_product.png)

# [Introduction](#introduction)

- Measures angular velocity.
- Calculates which side the robot is tilted or is getting more power.
- Maintains the robot’s balance and can be used for other movement applications.

- X Axis Pin
  1. ADC : Outputs the angular velocity into analog signals.
  2. GND
  3. VCC ( 5V )

- Y Axis Pin
  1. VCC ( 5V )
  2. GND
  3. ADC : Outputs the angular velocity value into analog signals.

# [Sensor Output](#sensor-output)

|Item|MAX|~|MIN|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Output Value|455|250|45|
|Angular Velocity|+300&deg;/s|0&deg;/s|-300&deg;/s|
|Voltage|2.23 V|1.23V|0.23V|

> Standard VCC Voltage Value is 5V.

- When the angular velocity is 0 (when still), the output value is approximately 250. When it suddenly turns to one axis, the max value output is 455 and the minimum 45, showing a 300&deg;/s angular velocity. Here the mark or sign represents direction.
- Depending on the temperature, there may be 1% difference.
- There may be a difference in value depending on the standard VCC voltage value and circuit noise. Thus, we recommend to average several values before use.(**When sampling, the robot must not be moving.**)
- You can READ the value using the [User’s Device Parameter] in RoboPlus Task.

- You may sample it out like below. It reads 10 values per 0.1 sec and makes an average. This value can be used as the standard value.
