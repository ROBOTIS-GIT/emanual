- Read through manual carefully before assembly.
- Do not use any other tools other than those provided in this kit. (no knives, cutters, drills, etc)
- Keep a safe distance from the robot during its activation.
- Be careful not to get fingers stuck between the robot joints.
- Do not store or operate the robot under direct sunlight.
- This project is not water proof. Do not use near water.
- Do not use near heat or fire.
- Do not disassemble or modify the parts.
- Keep all parts out of reach of small children.
- Do not drop or use sharp objects with the parts.
- Do not connect or let the li-ion battery come in contact with hair pins, clips, or any metal objects.
- Do not bend, twist, or modify the metal part of the li-ion battery.
- Do not place the li-ion battery in the microwave or solder any parts.
- Do not soak or place the li-ion battery in or near water.

### [Assembly Precautions](#assembly-precautions)
- Use only the designated screw driver in the kit(Size : M2)
- Do not use excessive force on nuts, bolts, or robotics parts.
- Avoid activating the robot on desks/tables to avoid from falling.
- Damages caused from falling are not covered under warranty.
- The gears in DYNAMIXEL XL-320 are subject to wear. Prolonged use, improper modification, excessive force, and damages will increase the gear backlash.

### [Precautions During Use](#precautions-during-use)

#### Charging the Li-ion battery
- Insert the li-ion battery in the charger case with the USB connector.
- The battery is shipped as uncharged. Please fully charge the battery before the first time use.

#### How to use the Rivet Tool

The Rivet is a simple tool to assemble plates.  
The `Rivet` is made up of a pair of `pin` and `pinhole`.  

![](/assets/images/edu/mini/darwin_mini_2_en.jpg)

In order to remove the rivet pick the pin head with the tool and pull it up.

![](/assets/images/edu/mini/darwin_mini_3_en.jpg)

In order to reuse the removed rivet, pinhole should fit into the hole first then pin should be inserted.

![](/assets/images/edu/mini/darwin_mini_4_en.jpg)

Try using provided tool when re-inserting the removed rivet.  
Hold the rivet with the tool and insert the pinhole into the plate hole.

#### Checking the li-ion battery voltage

The controller checks the battery voltage when the power is turned on.

|   Status    |           Movement            |
|:-----------:|:-----------------------------:|
|    Good     | All LEDs blink in RED 1 time  |
| Low Battery | All LEDs blink in RED 5 times |

**NOTE** : The controller acquires voltage from a specific DYNAMIXEL(ID 3) so ID 3 should be connected properly.

### RoboPlus Task

A Task is a set of motions to perform a certain actions. RoboPlus refers to the source code that specifies tasks to be executed by the robot as  Task Code'. The robot moves according to your task codes. RoboPlus Task is a software to make writing these task codes easier.
{: .notice}

#### RoboPlus Task Download and Usage
RoboPlus(R+) Task can be downloaded from the ROBOTIS website under Support à Download. Please refer to the RoboPlus Task for detailed on how to use the program.

- Click [here](/docs/en/software/rplus1/task/getting_started/) to learn more about RoboPlus Task.
- Click [here](http://en.robotis.com/BlueAD/board.php?bbs_id=downloads&mode=view&bbs_no=1152561&page=1&key=&keyword=&sort=&scate=) to download RoboPlus.

#### Task programming example
Below is a program example for ROBOTIS MINI. This program is a master and slave program where the left arm makes the same motions as the right arm.

![](/assets/images/edu/mini/mini_012.gif)

The example file can be downloaded at [Download Section](#download)

#### Download Task Code
The composed task code must be downloaded to the DARWIN-MINI. Downloading will save the task code to the controller.
- The PC must be connected to the controller. Please refer to the section above on connecting the ROBOTIS MINI with the PC via Bluetooth.
- Check the port ROBOTIS MINI is connected on.

  ![](/assets/images/edu/mini/mini_013.png)

  If you don’t know the port, select ‘Auto Search’.
  If RoboPlus can’t find the controller, the following message will show up on the screen. In this case, follow the instructions on the screen.

  ![](/assets/images/edu/mini/mini_014.png)


- Select the Download icon (shortcut key F6).

  ![](/assets/images/edu/mini/mini_015.png)

  If there is an error in the program, make sure to find and to fix the error.
  (Please refer to the rule check error message at the end of your program.)

- Download in progress.

  If downloading fails, please try again from the beginning.

  ![](/assets/images/edu/mini/mini_016.png)

- Turning the ROBOTIS MINI controller OFF then ON will automatically run the task code downloaded on the controller. Check whether the robot operates in the way it was downloaded in.

### RoboPlus Motion

Motion data is a set of motor position and speed data, which is required to make the robot move in a certain way. The robot requires the motion file to move, so the correct file must be downloaded to the robot to perform the correct action. RoboPlus MOTION is used to program various motions.
{: .notice}

![](/assets/images/edu/mini/mini_017.gif)

The Task Code composed in RoboPlus Task is a program. Motion file, on the other hand, is a data. Task codes decide how the robot moves, and making the moves to be carried out requires motion data.
Roboplus Motion is the program that helps to easily make the robot motion data.

#### How to download and use RoboPlus Motion
The RoboPlus Motion program can be downloaded from the ROBOTIS homepage.
Further instructions on how to use it can be found on the e-Manual.

- Click [here](/docs/en/software/rplus1/motion/) to learn more about RoboPlus Motion.
- Click [here](http://en.robotis.com/BlueAD/board.php?bbs_id=downloads&mode=view&bbs_no=1152561&page=1&key=&keyword=&sort=&scate=) to download RoboPlus.

#### DARWIN-MINI basic motion file
The basic ROBOTIS MINI motion file can be also downloaded on the e-Manual page.

The example file can be downloaded at [Download Section](#download)

Try editing the sample file referring to the RoboPlus Motion instructions on e-Manual.

#### Download Motion File
Download the edited motion file to the robot to use it in the ROBOTIS MINI App or task code.
Like the task code, the motion data needs to be downloaded to the controller once.

- The PC must be connected the controller. Please refer to the section above on connecting the DARWIN-MINI with the PC via Bluetooth.
- Click ‘connect’ on the bottom left.

  ![](/assets/images/edu/mini/mini_018.png)
