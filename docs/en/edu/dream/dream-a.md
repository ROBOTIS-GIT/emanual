# [Introduction](#introduction)

ROBOTIS DREAM is an entry level robotics kit optimized for learning and teaching robotics.

Set A combines the parts from the existing products ROBOTIS DREAM Level 1 and Level 2, and includes a much simpler QuickStart to get robotics education started.
- QuickStart includes assembly manual for 4 robot examples.
- Assembly manual for all 23 robots available through RoboPlus Design SW.
- Full workbook for students available (sold separately).

**CAUTION** : The controller([CM-150]) in ROBOTIS DREAM SET A contains a "Comprehensive Program" that can make the robot move without downloading a program. To program or download a program you will need the USB Cable included. If you want to build and program your robots using more parts and peripheral devices, please purchase the ROBOTIS DREAM SET B or necessary parts separately.

**WARNING** : ROBOTIS DREAM A has been discontinued.
