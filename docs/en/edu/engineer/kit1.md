### [2XL430-W250 DYNAMIXEL](#2xl430-w250-dynamixel)

![](/assets/images/edu/engineer/kit1/2xl430_intro.png)

**2XL430-W250** is a ground breaking DYNAMIXEL that allows to control **2 axis(2 DOF)** with a single module. In order to control 2 axis at the same time, each axle is assigned with different ID while sharing an identical Baudrate. Since the Control Table for each axle is separated except the Baudrate, 2XL can be applied in various applications.  

The usage is identical to other DYNAMIXEL's, but be aware that Firmware Recovery will reset both axis to factory settings.

## [BLE Signal Setting](#ble-signal-setting)

The Bluetooth communication could be unstable if the signal strength of BLE slave module in the CM-550 is weak or interfered.  
The BLE signal strength can be adjusted by R+ Manager 2.0 in this case.

Please refer to the method to adjust CM-550 BLE signal strength for various situations.

{% capture ble_setting %}  

|   My CM-550   | Other CM-550  | BLE Signal Strength |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|
| Unstable Link |  Stable Link  |      Increase       |
| Unstable Link | Unstable Link |      Increase       |
|  Stable Link  | Unstable Link |      Decrease       |
|  Stable Link  |  Stable Link  |      No Change      |

- If communication is unstable when using one CM-550 controller in the room, the signal strength might be weak. **Increase the BLE signal strength**.
- If communication is unstable when using multiple CM-550 controllers in the room, BLE signals could interrupt each other. **Increase the BLE signal strength of the unstable CM-550 or decrease the BLE signal strength of other stable CM-550**.
- If all CM-550 in the room are stable, **Maintain the BLE signal strength**.
{% endcapture %}
<div class="notice">{{ ble_setting | markdownify }}</div>

**NOTE** : The BLE signal strength and noise may differ by environment and the number of devices nearby.
