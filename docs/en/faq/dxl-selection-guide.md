# [Getting Started](#getting-started)

When selecting a DYNAMIXEL servo and control solution for your application, it is important to ensure that all of your chosen components are compatible with one another. One way to ensure that they will all be compatible with one another is to select them in the following order.  

- [DYNAMIXEL](#dynamixel)
- [Power](#power)
- [Controller & Interface](#controller--interface)
- [Software & Tools](#software--tools)

Each of these components is vital, and your choice for each will be dictated by the needs of your application, as well as your previous choices. It is important to consider all of the factors before you begin building your DYNAMIXEL, as well as during the selection process, so that you can ensure that all your choices are compatible.  

The remainder of this document will provide a helpful guide to assist you in selecting the DYNAMIXEL Smart servo and control solution perfect for your use case.

# [DYNAMIXEL](#dynamixel)

The first consideration for any DYNAMIXEL System is the actuator. Choosing a DYNAMIXEL for your application should start by understanding the capabilities and communication protocols supported by the actuator you are considering. 

## [Models](#models)

DYNAMIXELs come in a variety of sizes and with a variety of capabilities, with each model especially suited for a particular purpose. Before we look into the specifics of DYNAMIXEL performance, it is helpful to understand the differences between each DYNAMIXEL model. 

![](/assets/images/dxl/x/dxl_x_productline.png)
> DYNAMIXEL-X Series Naming Convention

![](/assets/images/dxl/p/dynamixel_pro_plus_lineup_table.jpg)
> DYNAMIXEL-P Series Naming Convention

This information is invaluable in narrowing your choices for actuators before moving on to considering the performance of the units.

**NOTE**: DYNAMIXEL AX and MX series actuators do not follow the naming convention, please refer to the [Performance](#performance) section for more information about identifying their capabilities.
{: .notice}

## [Performance](#performance)

The easiest way to select a DYNAMIXEL based on its performance is to look at the N-T graph:

![](/assets/images/dxl/pro/h54-100-s500-r_performance_graph_2.png)
> Performance Graph (N-T graph)

<!-- {% include en/dxl/note_performance_graph.md %} -->

Most DYNAMIXEL servos have a graph like that one located on their page here on the e-Manual. This graph provides an easy way to examine the overall performance characteristics of the servo at a glance, by graphing four of the most important metrics against one another:

1. **Torque(Nm)** - External load applied at the shaft of servo. By the Torque(Nm), Output Speed(A) and Current(A) are determined

2. **Speed(RPM)** - The output speed at the Torque. This shares the **black** line. 

3. **Current(A)** - The amount of current drawn at the Torque. Represented by the <span style="color:red">**red**</span> line.

4. **Efficiency(%)** - The output efficiency considering with a DC motor and its gearset. Different motors and gearset will perform more or less efficiently at different speeds and loads. This is represented by the <span style="color:green">**green**</span> line.

These factors can help you compare the performance of different DYNAMIXELs to help you find the one that is right for your use case.

**NOTE:** When selecting DYNAMIXELs based on rated torque, two measurements of torque are used depending on the specific DYNAMIXEL Model.
<br>**Continuous Torque** is the measurement of the amount of torque a DYNAMIXEL can produce constantly without risk of damage to the motor or gears.
<br>**Stall Torque** is the maximum amount of torque a DYNAMIXEL can produce before the internal motor stalls. 
<br>DYNAMIXEL's operational load should be based on the **Continuous Torque** rating. For servos where this value is not given, it can be estimated to be ~20% of **Stall Torque**
{: .notice}

<span style="color:red">**WARNING**</span>**: Operating DYNAMIXELS for extended periods at or near their stall torque can cause severe damage to the servos**
{: .notice--warning}

## [Communication](#communication)

Each DYNAMIXEL supports one of two serial communications protocols: [TTL](#ttl) or [RS-485](#rs-485). 

DYNAMIXEL actuators can be controlled by any device utilizing a compatible serial communications protocol.

<details>
<summary>
![](/assets/images/icon_unfold.png) **Tip**: **Looking for a solution to combine TTL and RS-485 DYNAMIXELs in your system?**
</summary>
Ordinarily, DYNAMIXELs utilizing different serial protocols can not communicate with one another over the same serial bus. This means that it is important to select servos using compatible communications protocols. In some applications, you may need to combine DYNAMIXELs with mismatched serial protocols. For these cases, you can combine mismatched serial protocols using a [DYNAMIXEL Communication Bridge](/docs/en/parts/interface/dxl_bridge/).

![](/assets/images/parts/interface/dxl_bridge/u2d2_bridge_ttl_485.png)

</details>

### [TTL](#ttl)

TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) is the common serial communication interface for DYNAMIXEL actuators. 

The simplest ways to identify TTL DYNAMIXEL actuators are a model name ending with a "-T" (e.g, XL330-M288-**T**) as well as the three pin JST ports.  

![](/assets/images/dxl/x/x_series_ttl_pin.png)  
> Pin Diagram for TTL Based DYNAMIXEL, using JST connectors

<details>
<summary>
![](/assets/images/icon_unfold.png) **Tip**: **TTL DYNAMIXEL Communication Circuit**
</summary>
DYNAMIXEL actuators operate using half-duplex UART communication. The following diagram shows the recommended circuit to convert full-duplex TTL to half-duplex TTL for DYNAMIXEL control.

**WARNING**: This circuit is designed for a 5V or 5V tolerant MCU. Otherwise, a Level Shifter will be required to match the voltage of the MCU.
{: .notice--warning}  
![](/assets/images/dxl/ttl_circuit.png)  

**NOTE**: 3.3V logic level DYNAMIXELs, such as XL330 series, are 5V tolerant on the data line. 
{: .notice}  
</details>

### [RS-485](#rs-485)

Some higher end DYNAMIXEL servos operate using the RS-485 communications protocol. If you need longer cabling distance or more resistance to interference, RS-485 will the best option for you. 

The simplest ways to identify RS-485 based DYNAMIXEL actuator are a model name ending with an "-R" (e.g, XD40-T150-**R**) as well as the four pin JST ports.

![](/assets/images/dxl/x/x_series_485_pin.png)

<details>
<summary>

</summary>

DYNAMIXEL actuators operate using half-duplex UART communication. The following diagram shows the recommended circuit to convert full-duplex RS-485 to half-duplex RS-485 for DYNAMIXEL control.

**WARNING**: This circuit is designed for a 5V or 5V tolerant MCU. Otherwise, a Level Shifter will be required to match the voltage of the MCU.

# [Power](#power)

Supplying your DYNAMIXELs with adequate power is important to ensure proper function of your DYNAMIXEL System. DYNAMIXELs can be powered in a variety of ways, depending on the needs of the DYNAMIXEL and your project.

**NOTE**: For allowable current to a daisy chain of DYNAMIXELs in your system, visit your product e-Manual and see the **Connector Information** (e.g,[XD540-T150 Connector Information](/docs/en/dxl/x/xd540-t150/#connector-information))  
Note that used connector may differ depending on your selection.
{: .notice}

## [Operating Voltage](#operating-voltage)

Prior to selecting your power solution, refer to the tables below for operating voltages for all DYNAMIXEL X-Series actuators.

### [DYNAMIXEL-X](#dynamixel-x)

Operating Voltage may differ depending on what model to be selected. See the following table.   

| Symbol |             Operating Voltage             |              Recommended              |
|:------:|:-----------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------:|
|   M    |                 3.7 ~ 6.0                 |                **5.0**                |
| T / W  | 10.0 ~ 14.8<br>(Max 12V for XL430, XC330) | **12.0** <br>(11.1V for XL430, XC330) |
| H / V  |                   24.0                    |               **24.0V**               |

**NOTE**: The **_Symbol_** in the table follows the [Naming Convention](#models) of DYNAMIXEL X-Series actuators. For DYNAMIXEL [AX](/docs/en/dxl/ax/ax-12a) and [MX](/docs/en/dxl/mx/mx-64) operating voltages refer to the eManual page for the servo.
{: .notice}

### [DYNAMIXEL-P](#dynamixel-p)

All DYNAMIXEL-P Series actuators run at 24.0V. This allows them to be used alongside DYNAMIXEL X `V` series 24v actuators.

<!-- 

|  Series   | Operating Voltage | Recommended |
|:---------:|:-----------------:|:-----------:|
| PM Series |       24.0        |  **24.0**   |
| PH Series |       24.0        |  **24.0**   |
