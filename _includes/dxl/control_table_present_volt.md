It is the size of the current voltage supplied.
This value is 10 times larger than the actual voltage. For example, when 10V is supplied, the data value is 100 (0x64)
If Present Voltage(42) value is out of range, Voltage Range Error Bit (Bit0) of Status Packet is returned as ‘1’ and Alarm is triggered and set the address 17 and set 1 to the Bit 0 of the address 18.
