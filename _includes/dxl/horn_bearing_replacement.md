### Installing the Horn

Place the thrust horn washer into the actuator before inserting the horn.
You must carefully align the horn to the wheel gear serration by aligning dots.

Once alignment is properly done, gently push the center of the horn toward the actuator.
Make sure that the horn washer is in place as you tighten the bolt.


### Installing the Bearing Set

You may need to remove the bearing set from the previous actuator and reinstall it into the new actuator.
The bearing set can also be purchased separately.
As bearing set is rotating freely, therefore alignment is not required when assembling to DYNAMIXEL.
