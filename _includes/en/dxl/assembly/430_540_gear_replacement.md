### [DYNAMIXEL Calibration](#dynamixel-calibration)

After a gear replacement has been completed, your DYNAMXIEL must be recalibrated to ensure positional accuracy.

See the following video on how to calibrate your DYNAMIXEL using R+ Manager 2.0.

**NOTE**: 
The USB2Dynamixel serial converter shown in the video above has been discontinued. The [U2D2](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/interface/u2d2/) serial converter is a direct replacement for this component, and should be used instead.

ROBOTIS recommends using the new [DYNAMIXEL Wizard 2.0](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_wizard2/#calibration) calibration software rather than our legacy R+ Manager 2.0 software used in the video.
