DYNAMIXEL's internal gears are subject to wear and tear through regular use. Regular maintenance and replacement of DYNAMIXEL gears is required to ensure maximum performance and precision.

The following video provides instructions on the DYNAMIXEL gear replacement process.

### [DYNAMIXEL Calibration](#dynamixel-calibration)

After a gear replacement has been completed, your DYNAMIXEL must be recalibrated to ensure positional accuracy.

See the following video on how to calibrate your DYNAMIXEL using R+ Manager 2.0.

**NOTE**: 
The USB2Dynamixel serial converter shown in the video above has been discontinued. The [U2D2](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/interface/u2d2/) serial converter is a direct replacement for this component, and should be used instead.

ROBOTIS recommends using the new [DYNAMIXEL Wizard 2.0](https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/software/dynamixel/dynamixel_wizard2/#calibration) calibration software rather than our legacy R+ Manager 2.0 software used in the video.
