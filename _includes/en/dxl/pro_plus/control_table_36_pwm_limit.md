This value indicates the maximum PWM output.  
Goal PWM(548) cannot be configured with any values exceeding PWM Limit(36).  
PWM Limit(36) is commonly applied in all operating mode as an output limit, therefore decreasing PWM output will also decrease torque and velocity of the device.  
For more details, please refer to the Gain section of each operating mode.
