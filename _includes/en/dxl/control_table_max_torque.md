It is the torque value of maximum output. 0 to 1,023 (0x3FF) can be used, and the unit is about 0.1%.  
For example, Data 1,023 (0x3FF) means that DYNAMIXEL will use 100% of the maximum torque it can produce while Data 512 (0x200) means that DYNAMIXEL will use 50% of the maximum torque.  
When the power is turned on, [Torque Limit(34)] is reset to the value of Max Torque(14).
