This value indicates maximum current(torque) output limit. Goal Current(102) can’t be configured with any values exceeding Current Limit(38). The Current Limit(38) is used in Torque Control Mode and Current-based Position Control Mode, therefore decreasing Current Limit(38) will result in decreasing torque of DYNAMIXEL. For more details, please refer to the Position PID Gain(80 ~ 84).
