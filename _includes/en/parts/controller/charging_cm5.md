To move a robot when it is not connected with SMPS, you have to use a battery. If the battery is discharged, please use by charging it according to following procedures.

`Note` While the CM-5 is being charged, the power LED blinks. The speed of blinking shows how much it is left before finishing the charging. It will be more faster as it completes the charging. Once the charging is done, it will blink for every 2 seconds.
