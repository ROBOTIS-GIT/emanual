As shown in BIOLOID learning material, CM-5 is supposed to support existing BIOLOID software (Behavior Control Program, Motion Editor etc). Therefore, if you want to use RoboPlus software in CM-5, you need to change the firmware into other firmware which supports Roboplus. However, if you change the firmware, you would no longer be able to use the existing Bioloid software.

The new-upgraded RoboPlus is an integrated programming software which can control Robotis products.
Therefore, CM-5 based robots can be controlled by programming with RoboPlus.
The usage is as below.

1. Download the [Latest Version of RoboPlus](http://en.robotis.com/BlueAD/board.php?bbs_id=downloads&mode=view&bbs_no=1152561&page=1&key=&keyword=&sort=&scate=).
2. Execute RoboPlus after installation.
3. Select RoboPlus Manager.
4. Connect CM-5 with the PC using serial cable.
5. Execute Firmware Wizard by pressing `Control Restoration` icon on RoboPlus Manager.

6. Select the port connected to the controller.
  Users must set manually the port connected to the controller. Finish other programs and continue the process since the controller cannot be recognized in case the port is in use.  Select the port connected to the controller and press "Find" button.

  To find the controller, the controller to be restored must be turned off and on.

8. Check the controller information.
  When the controller is found, the information of current controller and the firmware to download are appeared.  Check the model name whether the controller is connected by the user or not.  (The version of controller information is for Boot Loader, not for firmware.)
