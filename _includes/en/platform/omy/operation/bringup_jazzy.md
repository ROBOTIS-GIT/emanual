The OMY controller has been restructured to utilize the ros2_control framework and MoveIt 2 for enhanced flexibility, modularity, and usability. This updated controller allows for seamless integration with ROS 2-based systems, offering advanced features such as trajectory planning, real-time control, and state feedback.

### Launch Bringup
Open a new OM Container and launch the OMY packages.
