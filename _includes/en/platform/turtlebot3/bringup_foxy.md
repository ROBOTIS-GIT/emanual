### [Bringup TurtleBot3](#bringup-turtlebot3)
1. Open a new terminal from PC with `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T` and connect to Raspberry Pi with its IP address.  
  The default password is **turtlebot**.  
  ```bash
$ ssh ubuntu@{IP_ADDRESS_OF_RASPBERRY_PI}
  ```

2. Bring up basic packages to start TurtleBot3 applications. Please use the proper keyword among `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi` for the `TURTLEBOT3_MODEL` parameter.  
  ```bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py
  ```

3. If the TurtleBot3 model is `burger` as below, the terminal will print below messages.  
  ```bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py
