To use `turtlebot3_fake_node`, you need the `turtlebot3_simulation` metapackage. Install the package as shown in the following command.

**TIP**: The terminal application can be found with the Ubuntu search icon on the top left corner of the screen. The shortcut key for running the terminal is `Ctrl`-`Alt`-`T`.
{: .notice--success}

**NOTE**: The `turtlebot3_simulation` metapackage requires `turtlebot3` metapackage and `turtlebot3_msgs` package as a prerequisite. If you didn't install it in the [Install Dependent ROS Packages of PC Setup][pc_setup] section, install it first.
{: .notice--info}

```bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone -b kinetic-devel https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```

To launch the virtual robot, execute the `turtlebot3_fake.launch` file in the `turtlebot3_fake` package as shown below. The `turtlebot3_fake` is a very simple simulation node that can be run without having an actual robot. You can even control the virtual TurtleBot3 in RViz with a teleoperation node.

**TIP**: Before executing this command, you have to specify the model name of TurtleBot3. The `${TB3_MODEL}` is the name of the model you are using in `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi`. If you want to permanently set the export settings, please refer to [Export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL][export_turtlebot3_model]{: .popup} page.
