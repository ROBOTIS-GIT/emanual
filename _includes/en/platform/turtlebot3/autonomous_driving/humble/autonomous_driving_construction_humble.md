<!-- #### [Construction](#construction) -->

This section describes how to complete the construction mission. If the TurtleBot encounters an object while following a lane, it will swerve into the opposite lane to avoid the object before returning to its original lane.

##### [Construction avoidance process](#the-avoidance-process)

1. The TurtleBot is following a lane and it determines that there may be an obstacle in its path.

2. If an obstacle is detected within the danger zone, Turtlebot swerves to the opposite lane to avoid the obstacle.

3. The TurtleBot returns to it's original lane again and continues following it.

##### [How to Run Construction Mission](#how-to-run-construction-mission)

1. Close all terminals or terminate them with `Ctrl` + `C`

2. Open a new terminal and launch the Autorace Gazebo simulation.
```bash
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_autorace_2020.launch.py
```

3. Open a new terminal and launch the intrinsic calibration node.
```bash
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_autorace_camera intrinsic_camera_calibration.launch.py
```

4. Open a new terminal and launch the extrinsic calibration node.
```bash
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_autorace_camera extrinsic_camera_calibration.launch.py
```

5. Open a new terminal and launch the construction mission node.
```bash
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_autorace_mission mission_construction.launch.py
```

6. On the image window, you can watch the LiDAR visualization. The detected lidar points, and danger zone are displayed.
