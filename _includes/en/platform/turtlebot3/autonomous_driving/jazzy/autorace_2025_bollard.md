`Bollard Mission` involves navigating while avoiding static obstacles shaped like pillars.  
We use a `navigation2_pkg` to complete this mission.
`Navigation2` is a powerful ROS 2-based navigation framework that enables autonomous robots to plan and
follow paths while avoiding obstacles. By tuning appropriate parameters—such as those related to control server, local map, global map, etc.— the system can be optimized to handle the specific requirements of the Bollard Mission effectively.
