**Description of the stages**
1. **Stage 1 (No Obstacle)**  
Stage 1 is a 4x4 map with no obstacles.

<br>

2. **Stage 2 (Static Obstacle)**  
Stage 2 is a 4x4 map with four cylinders of static obstacles.

3. **Stage 3 (Moving Obstacle)**  
Stage 3 is a 4x4 map with four cylinders of moving obstacles.

<br>

4. **Stage 4 (Combination Obstacle)**  
Stage 4 is a 5x5 map with walls and two cylinders of moving obstacles.

**Understanding the Machine Learning simulation**
1. **Reset environment**  
Before the start of an episode, reset the position of the goal and regenerate the goal.  
<br>

2. **Select an action**  
The behavior is determined by epsilon value, which decreases as training progresses.  
<br>
    - **What is Q-value?**
        - Q-value is a key concept in reinforcement learning, meaning the expected cumulative reward for performing an action in a state.
        - The agent tries to maximize its reward by choosing the action with the highest Q-value.
    - **What is epsilon?**
        - Epsilon is the probability of an agent doing an 'Exploration'.
        - Exploration means trying out different behaviors because you don't know much about the environment, so the Q value isn't accurate yet.
        - If the epsilon value is high, random behaviors (exploration) are more likely to be selected. If the epsilon value is low, behaviors with high Q-values (exploitation) are more likely to be selected.  
<br>

3. **Training model**  
After the robot performs an action, it receives a reward or penalty for its behavior and checks to see if it reached its goal.  
<br>

**Machine Learning launch argument**  
`stage_num`
- default: 1
- description: The integer value of stage you want to run. This package has stations numbered 1 through 4, as described above.  

`max_training_episodes`
- default: 1000
- description: The integer value of an episode you want to run.  

`load_episode`
- default: 600
- description: The integer value of an episode you want to test. More complex stages may require more episodes to learn enough.  
<br>

**Run machine learning**  
1. **Bring the stage in Gazebo map.**
``` bash
$ ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_dqn_{$stage_num}.launch.py
```  
<br>

1. **Run Gazebo environment node.**  
This node manages the Gazebo environment. It regenerates the Goal and initializes the TurtleBot's location when an episode starts anew.
```bash
$ ros2 run turtlebot3_dqn dqn_gazebo {$stage_num}
```  
<br>

1. **Run DQN environment node.**  
This node manages the DQN environment. It calculates the state of the TurtleBot and uses it to determine rewards, success, and failure.
```bash
$ ros2 run turtlebot3_dqn dqn_environment
```  
<br>

1. **Run DQN agent node.**  
This node trains the TurtleBot. It trains TurtleBot with calculated rewards and determines its next behavior.
```bash
$ ros2 run turtlebot3_dqn dqn_agent {$stage_num} {$max_training_episodes}
```  
<br>

1. **Test traind model.**  
After training, to test the trained model, run test node instead of DQN agent node.
``` bash
$ ros2 run turtlebot3_dqn dqn_test {$stage_num} {$load_episode}
```  
<br>

**Run machine learning graph**
1. **Action graph**  
The Action graph shows the present TurtleBot's action and their rewards, and the total rewards in an episode.
```bash
$ ros2 run turtlebot3_dqn action_graph
```  
    ![action_graph](/assets/images/platform/turtlebot3/machine_learning/action_graph.png)  
<br>

1. **Result graph**  
The Result graph is a linear plot of the average of the maximum values of Q-Value and the total reward as each episode progresses.
```bash
$ ros2 run turtlebot3_dqn result_graph
```  
    **NOTE**: The graph is recorded from the time you run the node. For full recording, turn it on before you start learning.

<br>

**TensorBoard graph**  
Using TensorBoard, you can visualize the rewards per episode for each learning. The file is saved in `~/turtlebot3_dqn_logs/gradient_tape`.
1. **Run TensorBoard**  
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=~/turtlebot3_dqn_logs/gradient_tape
```  
<br>

2. **Access the TensorBoard in a browser**
