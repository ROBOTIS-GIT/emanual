Machine learning, learning through experience, is a data analysis technique that teaches computers to recognize what is natural for people and animals. There are three types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning.

This application is reinforcement learning with DQN (Deep Q-Learning). The reinforcement learning is concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment, so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward.

This shows reinforcement learning with TurtleBot3 in gazebo.
This reinforcement learning example uses the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm, utilizing data from the robot's Laser Distance Sensor (LDS).
